# PTCG-SM-Campaign
#### Pokemon Trading Card Game - Sun and Moon - Campaign

README is still WIP

## **Summary**

### What
This project aims to make a video game version of the PTCG (Pokemon Trading Card Game,) not entirely unlike the original PTCGs for the Gameboy Color. The implementation will be flexible and **customizable** (by the user.) The intent is to create a high quality base game **worth playing out-of-the-box,** but with an accessible collection of assets that can be **changed or added with as little overhead and difficulty as reasonably achievable**. 

### Why
The current, official video game implementation of the PTCG (PTCG Live) is cloud-based. At the time of writing this, it **lacks a campaign** and has **little to no support for CPU opponents**. Since it is solely a PvP experience, it is not customizable.

### How
This project is centered around Python 3 and utilizes mostly OOP (object-oriented) solutions. Implementation is still flexible and the overall trajectory is developing organically. Provided other people get on board with this or attempt to contribute, I will begin to outline a more specific plan for the project to make contributing easier. Suggestions and contributions that differ are welcome, as the project is still in its beginning stages and maintained solely by myself.

## **Development Trajectory**

The original plan was to create an almost completed backend for gameplay --including deck building, menu navigating, and the actual card mechanics-- before moving onto UI/graphics, which would steadily merge into story/game-design elements. This is still the general idea, however it is subject to change and some basic shell of a UI will likely appear for testing that will either be the backbone for the UI or a stand-in.

Pygame will most likely be used for UI implementation for simplicity.


## **Story/Setting**

The current focus will be set around the Alola region (Pokemon Sun and Moon era) in the Pokemon canon and will ideally include various important characters from that area. I'd like for it not to be *limited* to Alola, but that is the immediate geographic goal.
