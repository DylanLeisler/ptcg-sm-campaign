# ptcg-sm-campaign

EARLY DRAFT
WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED AND FORMATTED PROGRESSIVELY

This is an early version of what will eventually be my own take on the Pokemon Trading Card Game (as a video game.) 
The current, official application is cloud-based and almost entirely lacks any sort of campaign or CPU opponents.

This project aims to remedy that by providing a functional and adapatable implementation of the games mechanics. 
After that, it will branch out into a UI portion and a logic portion.
And hopefully, at the end, it will be made to resemble an actual video game campaign with story and setting.
